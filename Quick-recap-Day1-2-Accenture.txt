Quick recap 

- Introduction part
   - Linux vs Enterprise Linux 
   - What is OS and why used (OS types - Client, Server)
   - Server (RHEL - Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server - RHEL 8).
   - As of now (RHEL6/7/8 -in production)
     NOte: RHEL6 as of now under extended support.

- Basic commands and utilities 
   - Basic commands.
      whoami, pwd, ls, which, cd , cd .. (cd ../..), cd - , mkdir, rm, rmdir, tree, 
   - Concepts of commands 
     "COmmand Options Argument" 
	  cp -r dir1 dir2 
	  command - It's utility to perform any action.
	   NOte: Every command having manual pages and help option.
	   man command_name (man 1 command_type_1 or man 8 command_type_2)
	   command_type_1 - /bin or /usr/bin 
	   command_type_2 - /sbin or /usr/sbin 
	   
	   command --help 
	   
	   Option - Which modify the behaviour of the command.
	    NOte: All option details can be get via manual pages.
		
	   Argument - Data required to execuite coammnds.
	   NOte: All option details can be get via manual pages.
	   
	- Read Manual pages 
	   man 1 cp or man 8 useradd or man 5 shadow 
	   
	   /string  (this is for search for given string).
	   TYpe "n" for next search 
	   Type "N" for Previous seach 
	   Type "G" to reach to last line of the page.
	   Type "g" to reach the top line of the manual page.
	   Type "q" for quit 
	   
	 - Directory and file creations(operations onf it).
	  - mkdir  - TO create dir  
	  - touch  - To create emply file 
	  - vim    - Editor to create file with some contents.
	    vim file_name 
		PRESS key "i" - Insert mode (ONly in insert mode you can write/update the file).
		Type your contents 
		Again type your contents 
		...
		...
		Press "Ese" key to lock the screen (it's lock mode).
		Press ":wq"   - Recommended one
		Press ":wq!"  - This is forcefully saved and closed.
	   
	   - cat - to see the contents of file 
	   - grep - to get the perticular line (as per given string).
Take   - tail, head,wc, STDIO, STDIN, STERR, redirector (>, >>, 2> or &> and |). 


      - Absolute abd relative path 
	  - Linux hierarchy tree (default directories "/"). 
      
- User management 
       - Users
       - Type of users (Admin user - root, Normal user - john, user1, system user).
       - Groups 
       - Type of groups (Primary Group, 2ndry Group).
	     NOte: 
		  Primary group info (/etc/passwd)
		  2ndry group info  - /etc/group 
		  
	   - Password (/etc/shadow)
	   - HOme directory & mail dir 
	       HOme dir  - /home/user_name 
		   Mail file - /var/spool/mail/username 
		   
	   - commands (user management commands).
	      - useradd 
		  - userdel 
		  - usermod 
		  - groupadd
		  - groupmod 
		  - groupdel 
		  - passwd (echo redhat | passwd --stdin user_name).
		  - chmod (chmod 755 file/dir - 7 means = read(4)+write(2)+execute(1), 7 for owner, next 5 for groupowner, last 5 for other).
		  - chown ( chown user:groupowner file/dir , chmod root:unixadm /ORG, only root can change the ownership).
		    ownership can be group or direct owner.
	      - umask  - It provide default directories/files permission.
          - chage 
		  
		  
       - Important files w.r.t User management.
        /etc/passwd   (7 fields, each are seprated by ":")
   		/etc/group    (4 fields)
		/etc/shadow   (9 fields)
		/etc/login.def (This file refered when we execute user management commands. 
       
	    Note: To know more about above files, please use manual 5th page eg: (man 5 passwd).
		
	   - SUID, SGID, StickyBit 
	   - SUID explained - When SUID setup on any executable file then as per the permission and ownership (explained below).
	      a) When SUID setup on any executable file.
		      - HOw to set SUID - chmod 4<default-premission-continue> file_name 
			    Example: ls -l /usr/bin/passwd 
				
				-rwxr-xr-x   root root <SOME-info> /usr/bin/passwd 
				
				Owner - root 
				Group-Owner - root 
				
				  default-premission on this file is - 755 (owner permission=r+w+x, group=r+x, other=r+x)
                 It mean anyone can execute this file (/usr/bin/passwd)
				 
				 chmod 4755 /usr/bin/passwd
			  - SUID mean - when anyone execute mentioned file (/usr/bin/passwd) then it will execute as owner of this file.
			     Everyone execuite mentioned file as root user.
			  
		   b) What "/usr/bin/passwd" file will do ?
			    It change the password and update in "/etc/shadow" file.
				Even we don't have permission on "/etc/shadow - 000 ) but after that also any user able to update password to this file using "/usr/bin/passwd").
			  
        - SGID explained - When SGID setup on any executable dir then as per the permission and ownership (explained below).
	      a) When SGID setup on any directory.
		      HOw to set SGID - chmod 2<default-premission-continue> file_name 
			    Example: ls -l /ORG 
				
				drwxrwx---  root unixadm <SOME-info> /ORG  
				
				Owner - root 
				Group-Owner - unixadm 
				
				  default-premission on this file is - 770 (owner permission=r+w+x, group=r+w+x, other=---)
                 It mean only root and users belongs to "unixadm" group can access "/ORG" - Normal permission (770)
				 
				 chmod 2770 /ORG 
				 ls -ld /ORG 
				 drwxrws---  root unixadm /ORG 
				 
				 When SUID setup on "/ORG" directory.
				 Now if any file or directory created under "/ORG", it will automatically get same group ownership what you can set on "/ORG" 
				 
				 
				 
 		- StickyBit:-
		    It mean when stickybit setup then no one can delete the files/dir of others (even having full permission).
			- ONly root and owner of the file/dir can delete the file.
			
			 chmod 1777 /tmp_my 
			 ls -ld /tmp_my 
			 drwxrwxrwt   root root /tmp_my
